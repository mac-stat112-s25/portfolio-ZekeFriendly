I agree with the 90% – data wrangling isn’t something we have to do before we can do data science, it is data science! But let’s rethink the 10% – data wrangling is a fun and empowering puzzle!\n\nThe goals of data wrangling are to explore how to:\n\nGet data into the tidy shape / format we need for analysis. For example, we might want to:\n\nkeep only certain observations\ndefine new variables\nreformat or “clean” existing variables\ncombine various datasets\nprocess “string” or text data\n\n\nNumerically (not just visually) explore and summarize various characteristics of the variables in our dataset.",

    "text": "15.4 Review\nThere are lots and lots of steps that can go into data wrangling, thus lots and lots of relevant R functions. BUT just 6 functions can get us very far. People refer to these as the 6 main wrangling verbs or functions:\n\nwhy “verbs”? in the tidyverse grammar, functions serve as action words\n\nthe 6 verbs are all stored in the dplyr package within the tidyverse\n\neach verb acts on a data frame and returns a data frame\n\n\n\nverb\naction\n\n\n\narrange\n\narrange the rows according to some column\n\n\n\nfilter\n\nfilter out or obtain a subset of the rows\n\n\n\nselect\n\nselect a subset of columns\n\n\n\nmutate\n\nmutate or create a column\n\n\n\nsummarize\ncalculate a numerical summary of a column\n\n\n\ngroup_by\n\ngroup the rows by a specified column\n\n\n\n\nExample 1\nWhich verb would help us…\n\nkeep only information about state names, county names, and the 2020 and 2016 Democratic support (not the 2012 results, demographics, etc)\nget only the data on Minnesota\ndefine a new variable which calculates the change in Democratic support from 2016 to 2020, using dem_pct_20 and dem_pct_16\nsort the counties from highest to lowest Democratic support\ndetermine the total number of votes cast across all counties\nExample 2: Select Columns\nTo get a sense for the code structure, let’s explore a couple verbs together. To start, let’s simplify our dataset to include only some variables of interest. Specifically, select() only the columns relevant to state names, county names, and the 2020 and 2016 Democratic support:\n\n# What's the first argument? The second?\nselect(elections, c(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16))\n\nLet’s re-do this with the pipe function |&gt;:\n\nelections |&gt; \n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPipe Function |&gt;\n\n\n\n|&gt; “passes” objects, usually datasets, to a function:\nobject |&gt; function() is the same as function(object)\n\n\nExample 3: Filter Rows\nLet’s filter() out only the rows related to Minnesota (MN):\n\n# Without a pipe\nfilter(elections, state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# With a pipe\nelections |&gt; \n  filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== vs =\n\n\n\nWe use a == b to check whether a matches b.\nWe use a = b to define that a is equal to b. We typically use = for this purpose inside a function, and &lt;- for this purpose outside a function.\n\n# Ex: \"=\" defines x\nx = 2\nx\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n# Ex: \"==\" checks whether x is/matches 3\nx == 3\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n\nExample 4: Filter and Select\nLet’s combine select() and filter() to create a new dataset with info about the county names, and 2020 and 2016 Democratic support among Minnesota counties.\n\n# Without pipes\nfilter(select(elections, c(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16)), state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# With pipes: all verbs in 1 row\nelections |&gt; select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# With pipes: each verb in a new row\nelections |&gt; \n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; \n  filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# We can even do this with UN-tidyverse code in \"base\" R\nelections[elections$state_name == \"Minnesota\", c(1, 4, 8, 12)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\n\n\n\nWhy will we typically use:\n\ntidyverse code\nthe pipe function |&gt;\n\neach verb on a new row\n\n\n\nExample 5: Order of Operations\nSometimes, the order of operations matters, eg, putting on socks then shoes produces a different result than putting on shoes then socks. However, sometimes order doesn’t matter, eg, pouring cereal into a bowl then adding milk produces the same result as pouring milk into a bow then adding cereal (though one order is obviously better than the other ;)) Above (also copied below), we selected some columns and then filtered some rows:\n\nelections |&gt; \n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; \n  filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\nWould we get the same result if we reversed select() and filter()? Think first, then try it.\n\n# Try it\n\nExample 6: Storing Results\nTypically:\n\nWe want to store our data wrangling results.\nIt’s good practice to do so under a new name. We want to preserve, thus don’t want to overwrite, the original data (especially if our code contains errors!!).\n\n\n# Store the results\nmn &lt;- elections |&gt; \n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; \n  filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n# Always check it out to confirm it's what you want it to be!\nhead(mn)\n\n  state_name      county_name dem_pct_20 dem_pct_16\n1  Minnesota    Aitkin County      35.98      34.12\n2  Minnesota     Anoka County      47.79      41.01\n3  Minnesota    Becker County      33.96      30.47\n4  Minnesota  Beltrami County      47.24      40.76\n5  Minnesota    Benton County      32.70      28.33\n6  Minnesota Big Stone County      35.41      33.75\n\nnrow(mn)\n\n[1] 87\n\nnrow(elections)\n\n[1] 3109",

    "text": "15.5 Exercises\nExercise 1: select Practice\nUse select() to create a simplified dataset that we’ll use throughout the exercises below.\n\nStore this dataset as elections_small.\nOnly keep the following variables: state_name, county_name, total_votes_20, repub_pct_20, dem_pct_20, total_votes_16, dem_pct_16\n\n\n\n# Define elections_small\n#___ &lt;- ___ |&gt;\n#  ___(___)\n\n# Check out the first 6 rows to confirm your code did what you think it did!\n\nExercise 2: filter Demo\nWhereas select() selects certain variables or columns, filter() keeps certain units of observation or rows relative to their outcome on certain variables. To this end, we must:\n\nIdentify the variable(s) that are relevant to the filter.\n\nUse a “logical comparison operator” to define which values of the variable to keep:\n\n\nsymbol\nmeaning\n\n\n\n==\nequal to\n\n\n!=\nnot equal to\n\n\n&gt;\ngreater than\n\n\n&gt;=\ngreater than or equal to\n\n\n&lt;\nless than\n\n\n&lt;=\nless than or equal to\n\n\n%in% c(???, ???)\na list of multiple values\n\n\n\n\nUse quotes \"\" when specifying outcomes of interest for a categorical variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommenting/Uncommenting Code\n\n\n\nTo comment/uncomment several lines of code at once, highlight them then click ctrl/cmd+shift+c.\n\n\n\n# Keep only data on counties in Hawaii\n# elections_small |&gt;\n#  filter(___ ___ ___)\n\n\n# What does this do?\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   filter(state_name %in% c(\"Hawaii\", \"Delaware\"))\n\n\n# Keep only data on counties where the Republican got MORE THAN 93.97% of the vote in 2020\n# THINK: What variable is relevant here?\n\n\n# Keep only data on counties where the Republican got AT LEAST 93.97% of the vote in 2020\n# This should have 1 more row (observation) than your answer above\n\nWe can also filter with respect to 2 rules! Here, think what variables are relevant.\n\n# Keep only data on counties in Texas where the Democrat got more than 65% of the vote in 2020\n# Do this 2 ways.\n# Method 1: 2 filters with 1 condition each\n#elections_small |&gt; \n#  filter(___) |&gt; \n#  filter(___)\n\n# Method 2: 1 filter with 2 conditions\n#elections_small |&gt; \n#  filter(___, ___)\n\nExercise 3: arrange Demo\narrange() arranges or sorts the rows in a dataset according to a given column or variable, in ascending or descending order:\narrange(variable), arrange(desc(variable))\n\n# Arrange the counties in elections_small from lowest to highest percentage of 2020 Republican support\n# Print out just the first 6 rows\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   arrange(___) |&gt; \n#   head()\n\n\n# Arrange the counties in elections_small from highest to lowest percentage of 2020 Republican support\n# Print out just the first 6 rows\n\nExercise 4: mutate Demo\nmutate() can either transform / mutate an existing variable (column), or define a new variable based on existing ones.\nPart a\n\n# What did this code do?\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   mutate(diff_20 = repub_pct_20 - dem_pct_20) |&gt; \n#   head()\n\n\n# What did this code do?\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   mutate(repub_votes_20 = round(total_votes_20 * repub_pct_20/100)) |&gt; \n#   head()\n\n\n# What did this code do?\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   mutate(repub_win_20 = repub_pct_20 &gt; dem_pct_20) |&gt; \n#   head()\n\nPart b\n\n# You try\n# Define a variable that calculates the change in Dem support in 2020 vs 2016\n#elections_small |&gt; \n#  mutate(_____) |&gt; \n#  head()\n\n\n# You try\n# Define a variable that determines whether the Dem support was higher in 2020 than in 2016 (TRUE/FALSE)\n#elections_small |&gt; \n#  mutate(_____) |&gt; \n#  head()\n\nExercise 5: Pipe Series\nLet’s now combine these verbs into a pipe series!\nPart a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink then Run\n\n\n\nBEFORE running the below chunk, what do you think it will produce?\n\n\n\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   filter(state_name == \"Wisconsin\",\n#          repub_pct_20 &lt; dem_pct_20) |&gt; \n#   arrange(desc(total_votes_20)) |&gt; \n#   head()\n\nPart b\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink then Run\n\n\n\nBEFORE trying, what do you think will happen if you change the order of filter and arrange:\n\nthe results will be the same\nwe’ll get an error\nwe won’t get an error, but the results will be different\n\n\n\n\n# Now try it. Change the order of filter and arrange below.\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   filter(state_name == \"Wisconsin\",\n#          repub_pct_20 &lt; dem_pct_20) |&gt; \n#   arrange(desc(total_votes_20)) |&gt; \n#   head()\n\nPart c\nSo the order of filter() and arrange() did not matter – rerranging them produces the same results. BUT what is one advantage of filtering before arranging?\nPart d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink then Run\n\n\n\nBEFORE running the below chunk, what do you think it will produce?\n\n\n\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   filter(state_name == \"Delaware\") |&gt; \n#   mutate(repub_win_20 = repub_pct_20 &gt; dem_pct_20) |&gt; \n#   select(county_name, repub_pct_20, dem_pct_20, repub_win_20)\n\nPart e\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink then Run\n\n\n\nBEFORE trying, what do you think will happen if you change the order of mutate and select:\n\nthe results will be the same\nwe’ll get an error\nwe won’t get an error, but the results will be different\n\n\n\n\n# Now try it. Change the order of mutate and select below.\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   filter(state_name == \"Delaware\") |&gt; \n#   mutate(repub_win_20 = repub_pct_20 &gt; dem_pct_20) |&gt; \n#   select(county_name, repub_pct_20, dem_pct_20, repub_win_20)\n\nExercise 6: DIY Pipe Series\nWe’ve now learned 4 of the 6 wrangling verbs: select, filter, mutate, arrange. Let’s practice combining these into pipe series. Here are some hot tips:\n\nBefore writing any code, translate the prompt: how many distinct wrangling steps are needed and what verb do we need in each step?\nAdd each verb one at a time – don’t try writing a whole chunk at once.\n\nPart a\nShow just the counties in Minnesota and their Democratic 2020 vote percentage, from highest to lowest. Your answer should have just 2 columns.\nPart b\nCreate a new dataset named mn_wi that sorts the counties in Minnesota and Wisconsin from lowest to highest in terms of the change in Democratic vote percentage in 2020 vs 2016. This dataset should include the following variables (and only these variables): state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16, and a variable measuring the change in Democratic vote percentage in 2020 vs 2016.\n\n# Define the dataset\n# Only store the results once you're confident that they're correct\n\n\n# Check out the first 6 rows to confirm your results\n\nPart c\nConstruct and discuss a plot of the county-level change in Democratic vote percent in 2020 vs 2016, and how this differs between Minnesota and Wisconsin.\nExercise 7: summarize Demo\n6 verbs: select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by\nLet’s talk about the last 2 verbs. summarize() (or equivalently summarise()) takes an entire data frame as input and outputs a single row with one or more summary statistics. For each chunk below, indicate what the code does.\n\n# What does this do?\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   summarize(median(repub_pct_20))\n\n\n# What does this do?\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   summarize(median_repub = median(repub_pct_20))\n\n\n# What does this do?\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   summarize(median_repub = median(repub_pct_20), total_votes = sum(total_votes_20))\n\nExercise 8: summarize + group_by demo\nFinally, group_by() groups the units of observation or rows of a data frame by a specified set of variables. Alone, this function doesn’t change the appearance of our dataset or seem to do anything at all:\n\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   group_by(state_name)\n\nThough it does change the underlying structure of the dataset:\n\n# Check out the structure before and after group_by\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   class()\n# \n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   group_by(state_name) |&gt; \n#   class()\n\nWhere it really shines is in partnership with summarize().\n\n# What does this do?\n# (What if we didn't use group_by?)\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   group_by(state_name) |&gt; \n#   summarize(median_repub = median(repub_pct_20), total_votes = sum(total_votes_20)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflect\n\n\n\nNotice that group_by() with summarize() produces new data frame or tibble! But the units of observation are now states instead of counties within states.\n\n\nExercise 9: DIY\nLet’s practice (some of) our 6 verbs: select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by Remember:\n\nBefore writing any code, translate the given prompts: how many distinct wrangling steps are needed and what verb do we need in each step?\nAdd each verb one at a time.\n\nPart a\nNOTE: Part a is a challenge exercise. If you get really stuck, move on to Part b which is the same overall question, but with hints.\n\n# Sort the *states* from the most to least total votes cast in 2020\n\n\n# In 2020, what were the total number of votes for the Democratic candidate and the total number of votes for the Republican candidate in each *state*?\n\n\n# What states did the Democratic candidate win in 2020?\n\nPart b\n\n# Sort the states from the most to least total votes cast in 2020\n# HINT: Calculate the total number of votes in each state, then sort\n\n\n# In 2020, what were the total number of votes for the Democratic candidate and the total number of votes for the Republican candidate in each state?\n# HINT: First calculate the number of Dem and Repub votes in each *county*\n# Then group and summarize these by state\n\n\n# What states did the Democratic candidate win in 2020?\n# HINT: Start with the results from the previous chunk, and then keep only some rows\n\nExercise 10: Practice on New Data\nRecall the World Cup football/soccer data from TidyTuesday:\n\nworld_cup &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/worldcups.csv\")\n\nYou can find a codebook here. Use (some of) our 6 verbs (select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by) and data viz to address the following prompts.\n\n# In what years did Brazil win the World Cup?\n\n\n# What were the 6 World Cups with the highest attendance?\n\n\n# Construct a univariate plot of goals_scored (no wrangling necessary)\n# This provides a visual summary of how the number of goals_scored varies from World Cup to World Cup\n\n\n# Let's follow up the plot with some more precise numerical summaries\n# Calculate the min, median, and max number of goals_scored across all World Cups\n# NOTE: Visually compare these numerical summaries to what you observed in the plot\n\n\n# Construct a bivariate plot of how the number of goals_scored in the World Cup has changed over the years\n# No wrangling necessary\n\n\n# Our above summaries might be a bit misleading.\n# The number of games played at the World Cup varies.\n# Construct a bivariate plot of how the typical number of goals per game has changed over the years",

HINT: You’ll need as.numeric()\n\n\n\nSplit the course number into 3 separate variables: dept, number, and section. HINT: You can use separate() to split a variable into 3, not just 2 new variables.\n\nStore this as courses_clean so that you can use it later.\n\nCodecourses_clean &lt;- courses |&gt; \n  separate(avail_max, c(\"avail\", \"max\"), sep = \"/\") |&gt; \n  mutate(enroll = (as.numeric(max))-(as.numeric(avail))) |&gt; \n  separate(number, c('dept', 'number'), sep = \" \") |&gt; \n  separate(number, c('number', 'section'), sep = \"-\")\n\n\nExercise 3: Courses by department\nUsing courses_clean…\n\nCode# Identify the 6 departments that offered the most sections\ncourses_clean |&gt; \n  count(dept) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(n)) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n  dept  n\n1 SPAN 45\n2 BIOL 44\n3 ENVI 38\n4 PSYC 37\n5 CHEM 33\n6 COMP 31\n\nCode# Identify the 6 departments with the longest average course titles\ncourses_clean |&gt; \n  mutate(title = str_length(name)) |&gt; \n  group_by(dept) |&gt; \n  summarise(total = sum(title)) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(total)) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  dept  total\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 SPAN   1365\n2 ENVI   1136\n3 ENGL   1072\n4 POLI   1010\n5 PSYC   1003\n6 BIOL    983\n\n\nExercise 4: STAT courses\nPart a\nGet a subset of courses_clean that only includes courses taught by Alicia Johnson.\n\nCodecourses_clean |&gt; \n  filter(instructor == \"Alicia Johnson\")\n\n  dept number section   crn                         name  days            time\n1 STAT    253      01 10806 Statistical Machine Learning  T R  9:40 - 11:10 am\n2 STAT    253      02 10807 Statistical Machine Learning  T R   1:20 - 2:50 pm\n3 STAT    253      03 10808 Statistical Machine Learning  T R   3:00 - 4:30 pm\n        room     instructor avail max enroll\n1 THEATR 206 Alicia Johnson   -3   20     23\n2 THEATR 206 Alicia Johnson   -3   20     23\n3 THEATR 206 Alicia Johnson    2   20     18\n\n\nPart b\nCreate a new dataset from courses_clean, named stat, that only includes STAT sections. In this dataset:\n\n\nIn the course names:\n\nRemove “Introduction to” from any name.\nShorten “Statistical” to “Stat” where relevant.\n\n\nDefine a variable that records the start_time for the course.\nKeep only the number, name, start_time, enroll columns.\nThe result should have 19 rows and 4 columns.\n\n\nCodestat &lt;- courses_clean |&gt; \n  filter(dept == \"STAT\") |&gt; \n  mutate(name = str_replace(name, \"Introduction to \", \"\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(name = str_replace(name, \"Statistical\", \"Stat\")) |&gt; \n  mutate(start_time = str_sub(time, 1, 5)) |&gt; \n  select(number, name, start_time, enroll)\n\ndim(stat)\n\n[1] 19  4\n\n\nExercise 5: More cleaning\nIn the next exercises, we’ll dig into enrollments. Let’s get the data ready for that analysis here. Make the following changes to the courses_clean data. Because they have different enrollment structures, and we don’t want to compare apples and oranges, remove the following:\n\nall sections in PE and INTD (interdisciplinary studies courses)\nall music ensembles and dance practicums, i.e. all MUSI and THDA classes with numbers less than 100. HINT: !(dept == \"MUSI\" & as.numeric(number) &lt; 100)\nall lab sections. Be careful which variable you use here. For example, you don’t want to search by “Lab” and accidentally eliminate courses with words such as “Labor”.\n\nSave the results as enrollments (don’t overwrite courses_clean).\nExercise 6: Enrollment & departments\nExplore enrollments by department. You decide what research questions to focus on. Use both visual and numerical summaries.\nExercise 7: Enrollment & faculty\nLet’s now explore enrollments by instructor. In doing so, we have to be cautious of cross-listed courses that are listed under multiple different departments. Uncomment the code lines in the chunk below for an example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommenting/Uncommenting Code\n\n\n\nTo comment/uncomment several lines of code at once, highlight them then click ctrl/cmd+shift+c.\n\n\n\nCode# enrollments |&gt;\n#   filter(dept %in% c(\"STAT\", \"COMP\"), number == 112, section == \"01\")\n\n\nNotice that these are the exact same section! In order to not double count an instructor’s enrollments, we can keep only the courses that have distinct() combinations of days, time, instructor values. Uncomment the code lines in the chunk below.\n\nCode# enrollments_2 &lt;- enrollments |&gt; \n#   distinct(days, time, instructor, .keep_all = TRUE)\n\n# NOTE: By default this keeps the first department alphabetically\n# That's fine because we won't use this to analyze department enrollments!\n# enrollments_2 |&gt; \n#   filter(instructor == \"Brianna Heggeseth\", name == \"Introduction to Data Science\")\n\n\nNow, explore enrollments by instructor. You decide what research questions to focus on. Use both visual and numerical summaries.\nCAVEAT: The above code doesn’t deal with co-taught courses that have more than one instructor. Thus instructors that co-taught are recorded as a pair, and their co-taught enrollments aren’t added to their total enrollments. This is tough to get around with how the data were scraped as the instructor names are smushed together, not separated by a comma!\nOptional extra practice\n\nCode# Make a bar plot showing the number of night courses by day of the week\n# Use courses_clean\n\n\nDig Deeper: regex\nExample 4 gave 1 small example of a regular expression.\nThese are handy when we want process a string variable, but there’s no consistent pattern by which to do this. You must think about the structure of the string and how you can use regular expressions to capture the patterns you want (and exclude the patterns you don’t want).\nFor example, how would you describe the pattern of a 10-digit phone number? Limit yourself to just a US phone number for now.\n\nThe first 3 digits are the area code.\nThe next 3 digits are the exchange code.\nThe last 4 digits are the subscriber number.\n\nThus, a regular expression for a US phone number could be:\n\n\n[:digit:]{3}-[:digit:]{3}-[:digit:]{4} which limits you to XXX-XXX-XXXX pattern or\n\n\\\\([:digit:]{3}\\\\) [:digit:]{3}-[:digit:]{4} which limits you to (XXX) XXX-XXXX pattern or\n\n[:digit:]{3}\\\\.[:digit:]{3}\\\\.[:digit:]{4} which limits you to XXX.XXX.XXXX pattern\n\nThe following would include the three patterns above in addition to the XXXXXXXXXX pattern (no dashes or periods): - [\\\\(]*[:digit:]{3}[-.\\\\)]*[:digit:]{3}[-.]*[:digit:]{4}\nIn order to write a regular expression, you first need to consider what patterns you want to include and exclude.\nWork through the following examples, and the tutorial after them to learn about the syntax.\nEXAMPLES\n\nCode# Define some strings to play around with\nexample &lt;- \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n\n\n\nCodestr_replace(example, \"quick\", \"really quick\")\n\n[1] \"The really quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n\n\n\nCodestr_replace_all(example, \"(fox|dog)\", \"****\") # | reads as OR\n\n[1] \"The quick brown **** jumps over the lazy ****.\"\n\n\n\nCodestr_replace_all(example, \"(fox|dog).\", \"****\") # \".\" for any character\n\n[1] \"The quick brown ****jumps over the lazy ****\"\n\n\n\nCodestr_replace_all(example, \"(fox|dog)\\\\.$\", \"****\") # at end of sentence only, \"\\\\.\" only for a period\n\n[1] \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy ****\"\n\n\n\nCodestr_replace_all(example, \"the\", \"a\") # case-sensitive only matches one\n\n[1] \"The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog.\"\n\n\n\nCodestr_replace_all(example, \"[Tt]he\", \"a\") # # will match either t or T; could also make \"a\" conditional on capitalization of t\n\n[1] \"a quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog.\"\n\n\n\nCodestr_replace_all(example, \"[Tt]he\", \"a\") # first match only\n\n[1] \"a quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog.\"\n\n\n\nCode# More examples\nexample2 &lt;- \"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, / And sorry I could not travel both / And be one traveler, long I stood / And looked down one as far as I could\"\nexample3 &lt;- \"This is a test\"\n\n# Store the examples in 1 place\nexamples &lt;- c(example, example2, example3)\n\n\n\nCodepat &lt;- \"[^aeiouAEIOU ]{3}\" # Regular expression for three straight consonants.

This is because dem_support_20 is a character variable and R thinks of character strings as words, not category labels with any meaningful order (other than alphabetical):\n\nstr(elections)\n\n'data.frame':   3109 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ state_abbr    : chr  \"AL\" \"AL\" \"AL\" \"AL\" ...\n $ historical    : chr  \"red\" \"red\" \"red\" \"red\" ...\n $ county_name   : chr  \"Autauga County\" \"Baldwin County\" \"Barbour County\" \"Bibb County\" ...\n $ total_votes_20: int  27770 109679 10518 9595 27588 4613 9488 50983 15284 12301 ...\n $ repub_pct_20  : num  71.4 76.2 53.5 78.4 89.6 ...\n $ dem_pct_20    : num  27.02 22.41 45.79 20.7 9.57 ...\n $ dem_support_20: chr  \"low\" \"low\" \"low\" \"low\" ...\n\n\nWe can fix this by using fct_relevel() to both:\n\nStore dem_support_20 as a factor variable, the levels of which are recognized as specific levels or categories, not just words.\nSpecify a meaningful order for the levels of the factor variable.\n\n\n# Notice that the order of the levels is not alphabetical!\nelections &lt;- elections |&gt; \n  mutate(dem_support_20 = fct_relevel(dem_support_20, c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\")))\n\n# Notice the new structure of the dem_support_20 variable\nstr(elections)\n\n'data.frame':   3109 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ state_abbr    : chr  \"AL\" \"AL\" \"AL\" \"AL\" ...\n $ historical    : chr  \"red\" \"red\" \"red\" \"red\" ...\n $ county_name   : chr  \"Autauga County\" \"Baldwin County\" \"Barbour County\" \"Bibb County\" ...\n $ total_votes_20: int  27770 109679 10518 9595 27588 4613 9488 50983 15284 12301 ...\n $ repub_pct_20  : num  71.4 76.2 53.5 78.4 89.6 ...\n $ dem_pct_20    : num  27.02 22.41 45.79 20.7 9.57 ...\n $ dem_support_20: Factor w/ 3 levels \"low\",\"medium\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 3 1 1 1 1 ...\n\n\n\n# And plot dem_support_20\nggplot(elections, aes(x = dem_support_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3: Change Labels using fct_recode\n\nWe now have a factor variable, dem_support_20, with categories that are ordered in a meaningful way:\n\nelections |&gt; \n  count(dem_support_20)\n\n  dem_support_20    n\n1            low 2494\n2         medium  157\n3           high  458\n\n\nBut maybe we want to change up the category labels. For demo purposes, let’s create a new factor variable, results_20, that’s the same as dem_support_20 but with different category labels:\n\n# We can redefine any number of the category labels.\n# Here we'll relabel all 3 categories:\nelections &lt;- elections |&gt; \n  mutate(results_20 = fct_recode(dem_support_20, \n                                 \"strong republican\" = \"low\",\n                                 \"close race\" = \"medium\",\n                                 \"strong democrat\" = \"high\"))\n\n# Check it out\n# Note that the new category labels are still in a meaningful,\n# not necessarily alphabetical, order!\nelections |&gt; \n  count(results_20)\n\n         results_20    n\n1 strong republican 2494\n2        close race  157\n3   strong democrat  458\n\n\nExample 4: Re-order Levels using fct_relevel\n\nFinally, let’s explore how the Republican vote varied from county to county within each state:\n\n# Note that we're just piping the data into ggplot instead of writing\n# it as the first argument\nelections |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = state_abbr)) + \n    geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\nWarning: Groups with fewer than two data points have been dropped.\n\n\nWarning in max(ids, na.rm = TRUE): no non-missing arguments to max; returning\n-Inf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is too many density plots to put on top of one another. Let’s spread these out while keeping them in the same frame, hence easier to compare, using a joy plot or ridge plot:\n\nlibrary(ggridges)\nelections |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = state_abbr, fill = historical)) + \n    geom_density_ridges() + \n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\nPicking joint bandwidth of 4.43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOK, but this is alphabetical. Suppose we want to reorder the states according to their typical Republican support. Recall that we did something similar in Example 2, using fct_relevel() to specify a meaningful order for the dem_support_20 categories:\nfct_relevel(dem_support_20, c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\"))\nWe could use fct_relevel() to reorder the states here, but what would be the drawbacks?\nExample 5: Re-order levels Based on Another Variable using fct_reorder\n\nWhen a meaningful order for the categories of a factor variable can be defined by another variable in our dataset, we can use fct_reorder(). In our joy plot, let’s reorder the states according to their median Republican support:\n\n# Since we might want states to be alphabetical in other parts of our analysis,\n# we'll pipe the data into the ggplot without storing it:\nelections |&gt; \n  mutate(state_abbr = fct_reorder(state_abbr, repub_pct_20, .fun = \"median\")) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = state_abbr, fill = historical)) + \n    geom_density_ridges() + \n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\nPicking joint bandwidth of 4.43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How did the code change?\n# And the corresponding output?\nelections |&gt; \n  mutate(state_abbr = fct_reorder(state_abbr, repub_pct_20, .fun = \"median\", .desc = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = state_abbr, fill = historical)) + \n    geom_density_ridges() + \n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\nPicking joint bandwidth of 4.43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nThe forcats package, part of the tidyverse, includes handy functions for working with categorical variables (for + cats):\n\nHere are just some, few of which we explored above:\n\nfunctions for changing the order of factor levels\n\n\nfct_relevel() = manually reorder levels\n\nfct_reorder() = reorder levels according to values of another variable\n\n\nfct_infreq() = order levels from highest to lowest frequency\n\nfct_rev() = reverse the current order\n\n\nfunctions for changing the labels or values of factor levels\n\n\nfct_recode() = manually change levels\n\nfct_lump() = group together least common levels",

(This is less common than left_join() and inner_join()).\n\nNOTE: When an observation in the left table has multiple matches in the right table, these mutating joins produce a separate observation in the new table for each match.",

    "text": "20.4 Filtering Joins: semi, anti\n\nMutating joins combine information, thus increase the number of columns in a dataset (like mutate()). Filtering joins keep only certain observations in one dataset (like filter()), not based on rules related to any variables in the dataset, but on the observations that exist in another dataset. This is useful when we merely care about the membership or non-membership of an observation in the other dataset, not the raw data itself.\nExample 5\nIn our example data, suppose enrollments_1 only included courses being taught in the Theater building:\n\n\nstudents_1 |&gt; \n  semi_join(enrollments_1)\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(class)`\n\n\n  student    class\n1       A STAT 101\n2       B GEOL 101\n\n\n\nWhat did this do?

    "text": "20.6 Exercises\nExercise 1: Where are my keys?\nPart a\nDefine two new datasets, with different students and courses:\n\nstudents_2 &lt;- data.frame(\n  student = c(\"D\", \"E\", \"F\"),\n  class = c(\"COMP 101\", \"BIOL 101\", \"POLI 101\")\n)\n\n# Check it out\nstudents_2\n\n  student    class\n1       D COMP 101\n2       E BIOL 101\n3       F POLI 101\n\nenrollments_2 &lt;- data.frame(\n  course = c(\"ART 101\", \"BIOL 101\", \"COMP 101\"),\n  enrollment = c(18, 20, 19)\n)\n\n# Check it out\nenrollments_2\n\n    course enrollment\n1  ART 101         18\n2 BIOL 101         20\n3 COMP 101         19\n\n\nTo connect the course enrollments to the students’ courses, try do a left_join(). You get an error! Identify the problem by reviewing the error message and the datasets we’re trying to join.\n\n# eval = FALSE: don't evaluate this chunk when knitting. it produces an error.\nstudents_2 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_2)\n\nPart b\nThe problem is that course name, the key or variable that links these two datasets, is labeled differently: class in the students_2 data and course in the enrollments_2 data. Thus we have to specify these keys in our code:\n\nstudents_2 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_2, join_by(class == course))\n\n  student    class enrollment\n1       D COMP 101         19\n2       E BIOL 101         20\n3       F POLI 101         NA\n\n\n\n# The order of the keys is important:\n# join_by(\"left data key\" == \"right data key\")\n# The order is mixed up here, thus we get an error:\nstudents_2 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_2, join_by(course == class))\n\nPart c\nDefine another set of fake data which adds grade information:\n\n# Add student grades in each course\nstudents_3 &lt;- data.frame(\n  student = c(\"Y\", \"Y\", \"Z\", \"Z\"),\n  class = c(\"COMP 101\", \"BIOL 101\", \"POLI 101\", \"COMP 101\"),\n  grade = c(\"B\", \"S\", \"C\", \"A\")\n)\n\n# Check it out\nstudents_3\n\n  student    class grade\n1       Y COMP 101     B\n2       Y BIOL 101     S\n3       Z POLI 101     C\n4       Z COMP 101     A\n\n# Add average grades in each course\nenrollments_3 &lt;- data.frame(\n  class = c(\"ART 101\", \"BIOL 101\",\"COMP 101\"),\n  grade = c(\"B\", \"A\", \"A-\"),\n  enrollment = c(20, 18, 19)\n)\n\n# Check it out\nenrollments_3\n\n     class grade enrollment\n1  ART 101     B         20\n2 BIOL 101     A         18\n3 COMP 101    A-         19\n\n\nTry doing a left_join() to link the students’ classes to their enrollment info. Did this work? Try and figure out the culprit by examining the output.\n\nstudents_3 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_3)\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(class, grade)`\n\n\n  student    class grade enrollment\n1       Y COMP 101     B         NA\n2       Y BIOL 101     S         NA\n3       Z POLI 101     C         NA\n4       Z COMP 101     A         NA\n\n\nPart d\nThe issue here is that our datasets have 2 column names in common: class and grade. BUT grade is measuring 2 different things here: individual student grades in students_3 and average student grades in enrollments_3. Thus it doesn’t make sense to try to join the datasets with respect to this variable. We can again solve this by specifying that we want to join the datasets using the class variable as a key. What are grade.x and grade.y?\n\nstudents_3 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_3, join_by(class == class))\n\n  student    class grade.x grade.y enrollment\n1       Y COMP 101       B      A-         19\n2       Y BIOL 101       S       A         18\n3       Z POLI 101       C    &lt;NA&gt;         NA\n4       Z COMP 101       A      A-         19\n\n\nExercise 2: More small practice\nBefore applying these ideas to bigger datasets, let’s practice identifying which join is appropriate in different scenarios. Define the following fake data on voters (people who have voted) and contact info for voting age adults (people who could vote):\n\n# People who have voted\nvoters &lt;- data.frame(\n  id = c(\"A\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\"),\n  times_voted = c(2, 4, 17, 6, 20)\n)\n\nvoters\n\n  id times_voted\n1  A           2\n2  D           4\n3  E          17\n4  F           6\n5  G          20\n\n# Contact info for voting age adults\ncontact &lt;- data.frame(\n  name = c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"),\n  address = c(\"summit\", \"grand\", \"snelling\", \"fairview\"),\n  age = c(24, 89, 43, 38)\n)\n\ncontact\n\n  name  address age\n1    A   summit  24\n2    B    grand  89\n3    C snelling  43\n4    D fairview  38\n\n\nUse the appropriate join for each prompt below. In each case, think before you type:\n\nWhat dataset goes on the left?\nWhat do you want the resulting dataset to look like? How many rows and columns will it have?\n\n\n# 1. We want contact info for people who HAVEN'T voted\n\n\n# 2. We want contact info for people who HAVE voted\n\n\n# 3. We want any data available on each person\n\n\n# 4. When possible, we want to add contact info to the voting roster\n\nExercise 3: Bigger datasets\nLet’s apply these ideas to some bigger datasets. In grades, each row is a student-class pair with information on:\n\n\nsid = student ID\n\ngrade = student’s grade\n\nsessionID = an identifier of the class section\n\n\n# Get rid of some duplicate rows!\ngrades &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/grades.csv\") |&gt; \n  distinct(sid, sessionID, .keep_all = TRUE)\nhead(grades)\n\n     sid grade   sessionID\n1 S31185    D+ session1784\n2 S31185    B+ session1785\n3 S31185    A- session1791\n4 S31185    B+ session1792\n5 S31185    B- session1794\n6 S31185    C+ session1795\n\n\nIn courses, each row corresponds to a class section with information on:\n\n\nsessionID = an identifier of the class section\n\ndept = department\n\nlevel = course level (eg: 100)\n\nsem = semester\n\nenroll = enrollment (number of students)\n\niid = instructor ID\n\n\n\n    sessionID dept level    sem enroll     iid\n1 session1784    M   100 FA1991     22 inst265\n2 session1785    k   100 FA1991     52 inst458\n3 session1791    J   100 FA1993     22 inst223\n4 session1792    J   300 FA1993     20 inst235\n5 session1794    J   200 FA1993     22 inst234\n6 session1795    J   200 SP1994     26 inst230\n\n\nUse R code to take a quick glance at the data.\n\n# How many observations (rows) and variables (columns) are there in the grades data?\n\n\n# How many observations (rows) and variables (columns) are there in the courses data?\n\nExercise 4: Class size\nHow big are the classes?\nPart a\nBefore digging in, note that some courses are listed twice in the courses data:\n\ncourses |&gt; \n  count(sessionID) |&gt; \n  filter(n &gt; 1)\n\n     sessionID n\n1  session2047 2\n2  session2067 2\n3  session2448 2\n4  session2509 2\n5  session2541 2\n6  session2824 2\n7  session2826 2\n8  session2862 2\n9  session2897 2\n10 session3046 2\n11 session3057 2\n12 session3123 2\n13 session3243 2\n14 session3257 2\n15 session3387 2\n16 session3400 2\n17 session3414 2\n18 session3430 2\n19 session3489 2\n20 session3524 2\n21 session3629 2\n22 session3643 2\n23 session3821 2\n\n\nIf we pick out just 1 of these, we learn that some courses are cross-listed in multiple departments:\n\ncourses |&gt; \n  filter(sessionID == \"session2047\")\n\n    sessionID dept level    sem enroll     iid\n1 session2047    g   100 FA2001     12 inst436\n2 session2047    m   100 FA2001     28 inst436\n\n\nFor our class size exploration, obtain the total enrollments in each sessionID, combining any cross-listed sections. Save this as courses_combined. NOTE: There’s no joining to do here!\n\n# courses_combined &lt;- courses |&gt; \n#   ___(sessionID) |&gt; \n#   ___(enroll = sum(___))\n\n# Check that this has 1695 rows and 2 columns\n# dim(courses_combined)\n\nPart b\nLet’s first examine the question of class size from the administration’s viewpoint. To this end, calculate the median class size across all class sections. (The median is the middle or 50th percentile. Unlike the mean, it’s not skewed by outliers.) THINK FIRST:\n\nWhich of the 2 datasets do you need to answer this question? One? Both?\nIf you need course information, use courses_combined not courses.\nDo you have to do any joining? If so, which dataset will go on the left, i.e. which dataset includes your primary observations of interest? Which join function will you need?\nPart c\nBut how big are classes from the student perspective? To this end, calculate the median class size for each individual student. Once you have the correct output, store it as student_class_size. THINK FIRST:\n\nWhich of the 2 datasets do you need to answer this question? One? Both?\nIf you need course information, use courses_combined not courses.\nDo you have to do any joining? If so, which dataset will go on the left, i.e. which dataset includes your primary observations of interest? Which join function will you need?\nPart d\nThe median class size varies from student to student. To get a sense for the typical student experience and range in student experiences, construct and discuss a histogram of the median class sizes experienced by the students.\n\n# ggplot(student_class_size, aes(x = ___)) + \n#   geom___()\n\nExercise 5: Narrowing in on classes\nPart a\nShow data on the students that enrolled in session1986. THINK FIRST: Which of the 2 datasets do you need to answer this question? One? Both?\nPart b\nBelow is a dataset with all courses in department E:\n\ndept_E &lt;- courses |&gt; \n  filter(dept == \"E\")\n\nWhat students enrolled in classes in department E? (We just want info on the students, not the classes.)\nExercise 6: All the wrangling\nUse all of your wrangling skills to answer the following prompts! THINK FIRST:\n\nThink about what tables you might need to join (if any). Identify the corresponding variables to match.\nYou’ll need an extra table to convert grades to grade point averages:\n\n\ngpa_conversion &lt;- tibble(\n  grade = c(\"A+\", \"A\", \"A-\", \"B+\", \"B\", \"B-\", \"C+\", \"C\", \"C-\", \"D+\", \"D\", \"D-\", \"NC\", \"AU\", \"S\"), \n  gp = c(4.3, 4, 3.7, 3.3, 3, 2.7, 2.3, 2, 1.7, 1.3, 1, 0.7, 0, NA, NA)\n)\n\ngpa_conversion\n\n# A tibble: 15 × 2\n   grade    gp\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 A+      4.3\n 2 A       4  \n 3 A-      3.7\n 4 B+      3.3\n 5 B       3  \n 6 B-      2.7\n 7 C+      2.3\n 8 C       2  \n 9 C-      1.7\n10 D+      1.3\n11 D       1  \n12 D-      0.7\n13 NC      0  \n14 AU     NA  \n15 S      NA  \n\n\nPart a\nHow many total student enrollments are there in each department? Order from high to low.\nPart b\nWhat’s the grade-point average (GPA) for each student?\nPart c\nWhat’s the median GPA across all students?\nPart d\nWhat fraction of grades are below B+?\nPart e\nWhat’s the grade-point average for each instructor? Order from low to high.\nPart f\nCHALLENGE: Estimate the grade-point average for each department, and sort from low to high. NOTE: Don’t include cross-listed courses. Students in cross-listed courses could be enrolled under either department, and we do not know which department to assign the grade to. HINT: You’ll need to do multiple joins.",

    "section": "\n21.2 Data Import",
    "text": "21.2 Data Import\nStarting Data Project\nAny data science project consists of two phases:\n\n\nData Collection\nA data project starts with data! Thus far, you’ve either been given data, or used TidyTuesday data. In this unit:\n\nWe WILL explore how to find data, save data, import this data into RStudio, and do some preliminary data cleaning.\nWe will NOT discuss how to collect data from scratch (e.g. via experiment, observational study, or survey).\n\n\n\nData Analysis\nOnce we have data, we need to do some analysis. In this unit…\n\nWe WILL bring together our wrangling & visualization tools to discuss exploratory data analysis (EDA). EDA is the process of getting to know our data, obtaining insights from data, and using these insights to formulate, refine, and explore research questions.\nWe will NOT explore other types of analysis, such as modeling & prediction–if interested, take STAT 155 and 253 to learn more about these topics.\n\n\n\nNOTE: These skills are best learned through practice. We’ll just scratch the surface here.\nFile Formats\nBefore exploring how to find, store, import, check, and clean data, it’s important to recognize that data can be stored in various formats. We’ve been working with .csv files. In the background, these have “comma-separated values” (csv):\n\nBut there are many other common file types. For example, the following are compatible with R:\n\nExcel files: .xls, .xlsx\n\nR “data serialization” files: .rds\n\nfiles with tab-separated values: .tsv\n\n\n\nSTEP 1: Find Data\nCheck the Datasets page for information about how to find a dataset that fits your needs.\nSTEP 2: Save Data Locally\nUnless we’re just doing a quick, one-off data analysis, it’s important to store a local copy of a data file, i.e. save the data file to our own machine.\nMainly, we shouldn’t rely on another person / institution to store a data file online, in the same place, forever!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendations when Saving Data\n\n\n\nWhen saving your data, make sure they are\n\nin a nice format, eg, a csv file format\nwhere you’ll be able to find it again\nideally, within a folder that’s dedicated to the related project / assignment\nalongside the qmd file(s) where you’ll record your analysis of the data\n\n\n\nSTEP 3: Import Data to RStudio\nOnce we have a local copy of our data file, we need to get it into RStudio! This process depends on 2 things: (1) the file type (e.g. .csv); and (2) the file location, i.e. where it’s stored on your computer.\n1. FILE TYPE\nThe file type indicates which function we’ll need to import it. The table below lists some common import functions and when to use them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\nData file type\n\n\n\nread_csv()\n.csv - you can save Excel files and Google Sheets as .csv\n\n\nread_delim()\nother delimited formats (tab, space, etc.)\n\n\nread_sheet()\nGoogle Sheet\n\n\nst_read()\nspatial data shapefile\n\n\n\nNOTE: In comparison to read.csv, read_csv is faster when importing large data files and can more easily parse complicated datasets, eg, with dates, times, percentages.\n2. FILE LOCATION\nTo import the data, we apply the appropriate function from above to the file path.\nA file path is an address to where the file is stored on our computer or the web.\nConsider “1600 Grand Ave, St. Paul, MN 55105”. Think about how different parts of the address give increasingly more specific information about the location. “St. Paul, MN 55105” tells us the city and smaller region within the city, “Grand Ave” tells us the street, and “1600” tells us the specific location on the street.\nIn the example below, the file path is absolute where it tells us the location giving more and more specific information as you read it from left to right.\n\n“~”, on an Apple computer, tells you that you are looking in the user’s home directory.\n“Desktop” tells you to go to the Desktop within that home directory.\n“112” tells you that you are looking in the 112 folder on the Desktop.\n“data” tells you to next go in the data folder in the 112 folder.\n“my_data.csv” tells you that you are looking for a file called my_data.csv location within the data folder.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nmy_data &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/112/data/my_data.csv\")\n\nAbsolute file paths should only be used when reading files hosted on the web. Otherwise, relative file paths should be used. Relative file paths as the name suggest is relative to the file where the data file is read.\n\n# assume the code containing this script is under a folder called /src which\n# is at the same level of the /data folder\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nmy_data &lt;- read_csv(\"../data/my_data.csv\")\n\nSTEP 4: Check & Clean Data\nOnce the data is loaded, ask yourself a few questions:\nWhat’s the structure of the data?\n\nUse str() to learn about the numbers of variables and observations as well as the classes or types of variables (date, location, string, factor, number, boolean, etc.)\nUse head() to view the top of the data table\nUse View() to view the data in a spreadsheet-like viewer, use this command in the Console but don’t include it in your qmd files since it will prevent your project from rendering.\n\nIs there anything goofy that we need to clean before we can analyze the data?\n\nIs it in a tidy format?\nHow many rows are there? What does the row mean? What is an observation?\nIs there consistent formatting for categorical variables?\nIs there missing data that needs to be addressed?\nSTEP 5: Understand Data\nStart by understanding the data that is available to you. If you have a codebook, you have struck gold! If not (the more common case), you’ll need to do some detective work that often involves talking to people.\nAt this stage, ask yourself:\n\nWhere does my data come from? How was it collected?1\n\nIs there a codebook? If not, how can I learn more about it?\nAre there people I can reach out to who have experience with this data?",

    "text": "21.3 Exercises\nSuppose our goal is to work with data on movie reviews, and that we’ve already gone through the work to find a dataset. The imdb_5000_messy.csv file is posted on Moodle. Let’s work with it!\nExercise 1: Save Data Locally\nPart a\nOn your laptop:\n\nDownload the “imdb_5000_messy.csv” file from Moodle\nMove it to the data folder in your portfolio repository\nPart b\nHot tip: After saving your data file, it’s important to record appropriate citations and info in either a new qmd (eg: “imdb_5000_messy_README.qmd”) or in the qmd where you’ll analyze the data. These citations should include:\n\nthe data source, i.e. where you found the data\nthe data creator, i.e. who / what group collected the original data\npossibly a data codebook, i.e. descriptions of the data variables\n\nTo this end, check out where we originally got our IMDB data:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata\nAfter visiting that website, take some quick notes here on the data source and creator.\nExercise 2: Import Data to RStudio\nNow that we have a local copy of our data file, let’s get it into RStudio! Remember that this process depends on 2 things: the file type and location. Since our file type is a csv, we can import it using read_csv(). But we have to supply the file location through a file path. To this end, we can either use an absolute file path or a relative file path.\nPart a\nAn absolute file path describes the location of a file starting from the root or home directory. How we refer to the user root directory depends upon your machine:\n\nOn a Mac: ~\n\nOn Windows: typically C:\\\n\n\nThen the complete file path to the IMDB data file in the data folder, depending on your machine an where you created your portfolio project, can be:\n\nOn a Mac: ~/Desktop/portfolio/data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\nOn Windows: C:\\Desktop\\portfolio\\data\\imdb_5000_messy.csv or C:\\\\Desktop\\\\portfolio\\\\data\\\\imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\n\nPutting this together, use read_csv() with the appropriate absolute file path to import your data into RStudio. Save this as imdb_messy.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.2     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.4     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n# imdb_messy &lt;- read_csv(\"___\")\n\nPart b\nAbsolute file paths can get really long, depending upon our number of sub-folders, and they should not be used when sharing code with other and instead relative file paths should be used. A relative file path describes the location of a file from the current “working directory”, i.e. where RStudio would currently look for on your computer. Check what your working directory is inside this qmd:\n\n# This should be the folder where you stored this qmd!\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"/Users/ezekielfriendly/Documents/GitHub/portfolio-ZekeFriendly/ica\"\n\n\nNext, check what the working directory is for the console by typing getwd() in the console. This is probably different, meaning that the relative file paths that will work in your qmd won’t work in the console! You can either exclusively work inside your qmd, or change the working directory in your console, by navigating to the following in the upper toolbar: Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; To Source File location.\nPart c\nAs a good practice, we created a data folder and saved our data file (imdb_5000_messy.csv) into.\nSince our .qmd analysis and .csv data live in the same project, we don’t have to write out absolute file paths that go all the way to the root directory. We can use relative file paths that start from where our code file exists to where the data file exist:\n\nOn a Mac: ../data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\nOn Windows: ..\\data\\imdb_5000_messy.csv or ..\\\\data\\\\imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\n\nNOTE: .. means go up one level in the file hierarchy, ie, go to the parent folder/directory.\nPutting this together, use read_csv() with the appropriate relative file path to import your data into RStudio. Save this as imdb_temp (temp for “temporary”). Convince yourself that this worked, i.e. you get the same dataset as imdb_messy.\n\n#imdb_temp &lt;- read_csv(\"___\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Paths\n\n\n\nAbsolute file paths should be used when referring to files hosed on the web, eg, https://mac-stat.github.io/data/kiva_partners2.csv. In all other instances, relative file paths should be used.\n\n\nPart d: OPTIONAL\nSometimes, we don’t want to import the entire dataset. For example, we might want to…\n\nskips some rows, eg, if they’re just “filler”\nonly import the first “n” rows, eg, if the dataset is really large\nonly import a random subset of “n” rows, eg, if the dataset is really large\n\nThe “data import cheat sheet” at the top of this qmd, or Google, are handy resources here. As one example…\n\n# Try importing only the first 5 rows\n# read_csv(\"___\", n_max = ___)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommenting/Uncommenting Code\n\n\n\nTo comment/uncomment several lines of code at once, highlight them then click ctrl/cmd+shift+c.\n\n\nExercise 3: Check Data\nAfter importing new data into RStudio, you MUST do some quick checks of the data. Here are two first steps that are especially useful.\nPart a\nOpen imdb_messy in the spreadsheet-like viewer by typing View(imdb_messy) in the console. Sort this “spreadsheet” by different variables by clicking on the arrows next to the variable names. Do you notice anything unexpected?\nPart b\nDo a quick summary() of each variable in the dataset. One way to do this is below:\n\n# imdb_messy |&gt;\n#   mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor)) |&gt;  # convert characters to factors in order to summarize\n#   summary()\n\nFollow-up:\n\nWhat type of info is provided on quantitative variables?\nWhat type of info is provided on categorical variables?\nWhat stands out to you in these summaries? Is there anything you’d need to clean before using this data?\nExercise 4: Clean Data: Factor Variables 1\nIf you didn’t already in Exercise 3, check out the color variable in the imdb_messy dataset.\n\nWhat’s goofy about this / what do we need to fix?\nMore specifically, what different categories does the color variable take, and how many movies fall into each of these categories?\nExercise 5: Clean Data: Factor Variables 2\nWhen working with categorical variables like color, the categories must be “clean”, i.e. consistent and in the correct format. Let’s make that happen.\nPart a\nWe could open the .csv file in, say, Excel or Google sheets, clean up the color variable, save a clean copy, and then reimport that into RStudio. BUT that would be the wrong thing to do. Why is it important to use R code, which we then save inside this qmd, to clean our data?\nPart b\nLet’s use R code to change the color variable so that it appropriately combines the various categories into only 2: Color and Black_White. We’ve learned a couple sets of string-related tools that could be handy here. First, starting with the imdb_messy data, change the color variable using one of the functions we learned in the Factors lesson.\nfct_relevel(), fct_recode(), fct_reorder()\nStore your results in imdb_temp (don’t overwrite imdb_messy). To check your work, print out a count() table of the color variable in imdb_temp.\nPart c\nRepeat Part b using one of our string functions from the String lesson:\nstr_replace(), str_replace_all(), str_to_lower(), str_sub(), str_length(), str_detect()\nExercise 6: Clean Data: Missing Data 1\nThroughout these exercises, you’ve probably noticed that there’s a bunch of missing data. This is encoded as NA (not available) in R. There are a few questions to address about missing data:\n\n\nHow many values are missing data? What’s the volume of the missingness?\n\nWhy are some values missing?\n\nWhat should we do about the missing values?\n\nLet’s consider the first 2 questions in this exercise.\nPart a\nAs a first step, let’s simply understand the volume of NAs. Specifically:\n\n# Count the total number of rows in imdb_messy\n#___(imdb_messy)\n\n# Then count the number of NAs in each column\n#colSums(is.na(imdb_messy))\n\n# Then count the number of NAs in a specific column\n#imdb_messy |&gt; \n#  ___(___(is.na(actor_1_facebook_likes)))\n\nPart b\nAs a second step, let’s think about why some values are missing. Study the individual observations with NAs carefully. Why do you think they are missing? Are certain films more likely to have more NAs than others?\nPart c\nConsider a more specific example. Obtain a dataset of movies that are missing data on actor_1_facebook_likes. Then explain why you think there are NAs. HINT: is.na(___)\nExercise 7: Clean Data: Missing Data 2\nNext, let’s think about what to do about the missing values. There is no perfect or universal approach here. Rather, we must think carefully about…\n\nWhy the values are missing?\nWhat we want to do with our data?\nWhat is the impact of removing or replacing missing data on our work / conclusions?\n\nPart a\nCalculate the average duration of a film. THINK: How can we deal with the NA’s?\nFollow-up:\nHow are the NAs dealt with here? Did we have to create and save a new dataset in order to do this analysis?\nPart b\nTry out the drop_na() function:\n\n# imdb_temp &lt;- drop_na(imdb_messy)\n\nFollow-up questions:\n\nWhat did drop_na() do? How many data points are left?\nIn what situations might this function be a good idea?\nIn what situations might this function be a bad idea?\nPart c\ndrop_na() removes data points that have any NA values, even if we don’t care about the variable(s) for which data is missing. This can result in losing a lot of data points that do have data on the variables we actually care about! For example, suppose we only want to explore the relationship between film duration and whether it’s in color. Check out a plot:\n\n# ggplot(imdb_messy, aes(x = duration, fill = color)) + \n#   geom_density()\n\nFollow-up:\n\nCreate a new dataset with only and all movies that have complete info on duration and color. HINT: You could use !is.na(___) or drop_na() (differently than above)\nUse this new dataset to create a new and improved plot.\nHow many movies remain in your new dataset? Hence why this is better than using the dataset from part b?\nPart d\nIn some cases, missing data is more non-data than unknown data. For example, the films with NAs for actor_1_facebook_likes actually have 0 Facebook likes–they don’t even have actors! In these cases, we can replace the NAs with a 0. Use the replace_na() function to create a new dataset (imdb_temp) that replaces the NAs in actor_1_facebook_likes with 0. You’ll have to check out the help file for this function.\nExercise 8: New Data + Projects\nLet’s practice the above ideas while also planting some seeds for the course project. Each group will pick and analyze their own dataset. The people you’re sitting with today aren’t necessarily your project groups! BUT do some brainstorming together:\n\nShare with each other: What are some personal hobbies or passions or things you’ve been thinking about or things you’d like to learn more about? Don’t think too hard about this! Just share what’s at the top of mind today.\nEach individual: Find a dataset online that’s related to one of the topics you shared in the above prompt.\nDiscuss what data you found with your group!\nLoad the data into RStudio, perform some basic checks, and perform some preliminary cleaning, as necessary.",
